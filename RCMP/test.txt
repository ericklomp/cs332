Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson is on the most dangerous quest of his life. With the help of a satyr and a 
daughter of Athena, Percy must journey across the United States to catch a thief who has stolen the original 
weapon of mass destruction — Zeus’ master bolt. Along the way, he must face a host of mythological enemies 
determined to stop him. Most of all, he must come to terms with a father he has never known, and an Oracle 
that has warned him of betrayal by a friend.
